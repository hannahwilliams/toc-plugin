- [ ] Styles for certain elements: text headers, sub-header, horizontal rules, blockquote, code, hidden-show for answers (like stack overflow), embeeded code gist/code editor, ect.)
- [ ] Add `<section>` elements to wrap article/post content for use in a accordion styled nav menu
- [ ] GitBooks demo
- [ ] Footnotes support
- [ ] Download icons based on type of download
- [ ] Ajax loaded comments/contents with spinner
- [ ] Loading CSS
